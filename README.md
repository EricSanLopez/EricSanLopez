## 🔍 About Me

I'm a curious and dedicated Artificial Intelligence Master's student with a strong mathematical and programming background. My journey started with a high school robotics project and has since evolved into research in deep learning and computer vision.

Currently diving deeper into AI engineering at KU Leuven, I thrive on learning, collaboration, and tackling complex problems. I bring a mix of technical skills and soft skills that help bridge the gap between theory and practical impact.
